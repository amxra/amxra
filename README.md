While I am passionate about all aspects of web technologies, I have a high-key interest in frontend development where I make use of technologies such as HTML, CSS, SCSS JavaScript, React, Bootstrap and jQuery to bring alluring designs to life. I have acquired the skills to build fully functional and responsive websites/ applications, implement CRUD operations, perform client side authentication, routing and testing amongst other things while using Github to manage version control. I am also capable of building RESTful apis using Nodejs.

I am curretly open for work and collaboration!
